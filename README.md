### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile!

My name is **Lydia** and I am a product designer with keen interest in creating easy to use and digital products. Currently, I am exploring the world of frontend development, enjoying every bit of the learning journey and contributing my design skills to open source project [OpenRefine.](https://openrefine.org/) , where I was an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) intern in the May - August, 2023 cohort and worked on improving workflows for design contributions and collaboration.

I also enjoy sharing my tech journey and insights with others, and I do so through my blog, [Lydia and Colors.](https://lydiaandcolors.substack.com/)

My Github account showcases a mix of design and code-related projects that I have worked on. From creating wireframes and prototypes to writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy every aspect of the design and development process.

I am availoable for a job and always looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to open-source projects. I believe in the power of community-driven initiatives and the positive impact they can have on the industry.

So, feel free to explore my Github profile and connect with me. Let's create something awesome together!
