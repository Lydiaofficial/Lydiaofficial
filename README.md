### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile!

As a User Experience Designer, I enjoy creating user interfaces that solve user problems and enhance user satisfaction. I have applied my skills and knowledge to various projects and platforms, such as OpenRefine, an open source tool for data cleaning and transformation, and EmmsDan Industries, a leading provider of software solutions for businesses. 

At EmmsDan Industries, I worked as a Product Designer for over a year, where I spearheaded the design and development of Kirgawa, optimizing the workflow and user experience for clients and users. 

I also have a passion for blogging and technical writing, and I have managed blogs on Substack, using Markdown to create engaging and informative content. Additionally, I contribute to open source via OpenRefine. 

Finally, I am enrolled in Scrimba 's Frontend Career Path program where I have been taking courses on frontend development and striving to transition to UI engineering
