### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile!

I am a passionate product designer with a keen interest in creating user-centric and aesthetically pleasing digital products. Currently, I am exploring the world of frontend development and enjoying every bit of the learning journey.

I also enjoy sharing my tech journey and insights with others, and I do so through my blog, which you can find at https://techingthroughlife.substack.com/.

My Github account showcases a mix of design and code-related projects that I have worked on. From creating wireframes and prototypes to writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy every aspect of the design and development process.

I am always looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to open-source projects. I believe in the power of community-driven initiatives and the positive impact they can have on the industry.

So, feel free to explore my Github profile and connect with me. Let's create something awesome together!
